This repository exists to get started with GitHub. For this exercise we'll be creating documents with places to visit.

Use `.md` at the end of your files to make them [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)!

You should work on a new branch and open a pull request when you want to contribute your document back to this repository.
